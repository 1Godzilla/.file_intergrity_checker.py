File Integrity Checker

This project provides a simple Python-based File Integrity Checker that uses cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA-256) to verify the integrity of files. It ensures that files have not been altered or corrupted during transfer, storage, or processing.

Features

	•	Generates cryptographic hash values (e.g., SHA-256) for files.
	•	Compares current file hash with a previously saved hash to check for integrity.
	•	Supports multiple hash algorithms (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, etc.).
	•	Works with files of any size.

How It Works

	1.	Hash Generation: Computes the hash of a file using a cryptographic algorithm.
	2.	Hash Verification: Compares the computed hash with a previously recorded hash to confirm the file’s integrity.
	3.	Result: Identifies whether the file is intact or has been tampered with.

Why File Integrity Checking?

	•	Data Security: Prevents undetected file tampering or corruption.
	•	Secure Transfers: Confirms file integrity after transmission.
	•	Digital Forensics: Verifies if evidence files remain unaltered.
	•	System Security: Detects malware infections by checking system file integrity.

Usage

Prerequisites

	•	Python 3.x installed.

Running the Script

	1.	Clone or download the script to your machine.
	2.	Install any required libraries (if applicable).
	3.	Save the script as file_integrity_checker.py.
	4.	Open a terminal and navigate to the script’s directory.
	5.	Run the script:

python file_integrity_checker.py



Example Workflow

	1.	Generate Hash:
	•	Compute and save the hash of a file for future reference.
	2.	Verify File:
	•	Compare the current file’s hash to the saved hash.

Example Output

Input

	•	File: example.txt
	•	Hash Algorithm: SHA-256

Output

Generating hash for example.txt...
Generated hash: 3a7bd3e2360a2d5893b7ef52a7bfbfc4f5a88c65
Comparing hash...
Hashes match! The file is intact.

Customization

	•	Algorithms: Modify the script to use different hashing algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1.
	•	File Extensions: Adjust to work only with specific file types, if necessary.
